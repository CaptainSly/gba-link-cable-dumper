# gba-link-cable-dumper
A gc and wii homebrew app to get gba roms and saves via the gc gba link cable.  

# Usage
Just have a gc controller in port 1 and a gba without a game inserted in port 2. 
The gba and sav files dumped will be placed in a folder called "dumps" on your main device (sd gecko on gamecube and sd/usb on wii).
